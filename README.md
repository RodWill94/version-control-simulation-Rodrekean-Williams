The steps I took to create the branches was tedious. My first step was creating the header/feature branch. After creating that branch I staged and committed it, and then switched back to the main branch and then created a feature/footer branch.I then made changes to the html code on the feature/header branch to the footer. I then merged each branch into the main branch one by one. After adding the feature/footer branch into the main I encountered a conflicit adding the feature/header branch to the main branch. The changes I made to the feature/header branch to the footer of the html code overwrote the footer in the feature/footer footer of the html code.The pull request allows other people I am working on the project with to view, and add comments to my code.
